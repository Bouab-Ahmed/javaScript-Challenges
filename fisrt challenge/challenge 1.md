# Write Number in Expanded Form

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form. For example:

```
expandedForm(12); // Should return '10 + 2'
expandedForm(42); // Should return '40 + 2'
expandedForm(70304); // Should return '70000 + 300 + 4'
```

## Note

All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.
